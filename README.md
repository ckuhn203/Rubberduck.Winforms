# Rubberduck.Winforms
A DataAnnotations and Validation framework for Winforms

## Mission Statement

We all have legacy code. 

Rubberduck.Winforms is meant to bridge the gap between Winforms and WPF.

It enables you to:

  1. Use the same models across WPF, ASP.NET-MVC, and WINFORMS.
  2. Refactor your existing Winforms applications into a state where it is relatively simple to move your existing application to WPF.
    Letting you avoid that "big re-write", while still moving forward towards a modern platform.
  3. Get rid of all ugly validation Message Boxes by providing a more modern UI.
  4. Get rid of all that ugly boiler plate code by providing simplified API.
